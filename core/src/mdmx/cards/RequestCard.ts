// `RequestCard.astro` renders four language tabs (curl, Python, JS, PHP) for
// human readers comparing client libraries. The markdown target is read by
// LLMs, not browsed tab-by-tab — curl alone says everything an agent needs
// to reproduce the request, so the other three are skipped here. When an
// endpoint has more than one request example (e.g. direct vs. resumable file
// upload), all of them are printed as curl — they're semantically distinct
// requests, unlike the four language variants of a single example.
